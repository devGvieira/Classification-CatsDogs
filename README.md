# AI for Classifying Dogs and Cats Images

The present notebook makes use of deep learning applied to computational vision for classifying images of cats and dogs. Such artificial intelligence software was trained on about 700 images of cats and dogs using a sequential neural network built using Keras.

The data used on the training may be accessed on:

Note:

It is still a work in progress, the network's architecture will be revisited.
