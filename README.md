# AI for Classifying Dogs and Cats Pictures

The present notebook makes use of deep learning applied to computational vision, it regards an algorithm capable of distinguinshing between images of cats and dogs. Such artificial intelligence was trained on about 700 images of cats and dogs and through a sequential neural network built using Keras, as a result it presented an accuracy of approximately 65%.
